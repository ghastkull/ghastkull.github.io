            <p>I know this doesn't count as a "city", but I included Stilwell because the company I work for has just opened a new site at this location, and this is the reason I am interested in researching/moving to this region. Stilwell is in the rural area just outside of the Kansas City metropolitan area. Stilwell originally began as a location to run railroads through to the south in the 1880s. Today it is mostly agricultural land, with affordable land options within driving distance of KC. The city of Overland Park is nearby and has recently increased the need for new neighborhoods and the cost of land in the area.
